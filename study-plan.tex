    \maketitle

    \section{Research components:}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Systematic literature review ( following the guidelines of PRISMA and Barbara An Kitchenham ) 
        \item Improved searched strategy by using PRISMA-S
        \item Thematic synthesis using Cruzes, D. S. \& Dyb√• approach 
        \item Capturing microservices patterns following the TOGAF template 
        \item Understanding the current state of big data architectures  
        \item Mapping the microservices patterns against big data architectures and see if they can solve some of its issues
        \item Discussion
        \item Threat to validity
        \item Conclusion and further research
    \end{enumerate}
